# This vs. That DOT Show

These are the content files associated with the website (thisvsthat.show)[https://thisvsthat.show].
First of all I want to once again get out of the way that I am not affiliated with Hoonigan in any way and do not claim ownership or copyright or trademarks of anything, hoping that I wont get sued this way and will be allowed to continue providing this record of data. This is an innocent attempt at keeping the internet a weird and fun place to explore.  
I do not intend on using this domain to host any hateful or damaging content in any relation to Hoonigan or any of it's employees specifically, nor do I intend to host anything else other than this website showing some statistics.
The domain was simply free and I figured I build some fun for myself and others to enjoy.

I hope that you will be able to find some value in the data that I collected and present on the website. Feel free to download the data yourself and either import it into run of the mill programs like Excel, heck maybe even Google Docs or import the `pg_dump` output of everything that I provide.
